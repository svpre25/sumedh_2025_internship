Tetechnical analysis of a workout durationâ€“based scoring algorithm: examines deficits (ie how scores short but intense workouts as zero), gives a failed logarithmic adjustment that still ignores workout intensity, & how  of duration scoring remains effort-agnostic.. Defines attributes/reqs for a "good" scoring function (mixture of WHO-based thresholds + partial credit for short sessions when intensity is high).
