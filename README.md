# Workout durationâ€“based scoring Algorithms
Examines deficits (ie how scores short but intense workouts as zero), gives a failed logarithmic adjustment that still ignores workout intensity, & how of duration scoring remains effort-agnostic. Defines attributes/reqs for a "good" scoring function (mixture of WHO-based thresholds + partial credit for short sessions when intensity is high).

# Stress Testing Celery/Reddis for Incoming/Streaming Data
Tests varying size batches of DailyLog database entries form small batches like 10-50 entries up to hundreds &  submitting each entry as a Celery background task and measuring how long the entire process took. Caompared submission speed, task completion time, and overall throughput across different to see where the system performs most efficiently.
