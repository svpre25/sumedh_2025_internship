Summary of work/discoveries/research from Sumedh Vemuganti: May 2025 - Sept 2025


This document is a technical analysis of a workout durationâ€“based scoring algorithm. It highlights the failure of the current method, which unfairly scores short but intense workouts as zero, and reviews a failed logarithmic adjustment that still ignores workout intensity. It then defines requirements for a new scoring function: maintaining WHO-based thresholds, granting partial credit for short sessions when intensity is high, capping scores at 100, and preventing gaming. Finally, it identifies the open issue that duration scoring remains effort-agnostic.
