# Sumedh 2025 Internship
Summary of work/discoveries/research May 2025 - Sept 2025


**A technical analysis of a workout durationâ€“based scoring algorithm:**
Examines deficits (ie how scores short but intense workouts as zero), gives a failed logarithmic adjustment that still ignores workout intensity, & how of duration scoring remains effort-agnostic. Defines attributes/reqs for a "good" scoring function (mixture of WHO-based thresholds + partial credit for short sessions when intensity is high). https://github.com/svpre25/sumedh_2025_internship/blob/main/Brainstorming%20Improvements%20to%20the%20Physical%20Activity%20Score%20Computation.pdf
